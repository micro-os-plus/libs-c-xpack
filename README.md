# A source xPack with ÂµOS++ complementary C library functions

These are some files that complement or extend the C library:

- `c-syscalls-empty.c` define weak empty syscalls to keep the linker happy; redefine those needed for retargeted configurations;
- `_sbrk.c` allocates block of memory in the free store (the heap) at the end of RAM, up to the stack; must match the definitons in the linker script;
- `stdlib/assert.c` defines the function to be called when assertions are taken;
- `stdlib/atexit.cpp` defines a simple registry for functions to be called when the program is terminated; useful for semihosting applications that terminate normally; the size of the static array is `MICRO_OS_PLUS_INTEGER_ATEXIT_ARRAY_SIZE`, default 3;
- `stdlib/exit.c` defines the functionality of `exit()` and `abort()`
- `stdlib/init-fini.c` defines weak empty `_init()` and `_fini()`, to keep linker happy.

The project is hosted on GitHub as
[micro-os-plus/libs-c-xpack](https://github.com/micro-os-plus/libs-c-xpack).

## Maintainer info

This page is addressed to developers who plan to include this package
into their own projects.

For maintainer infos, please see the
[README-MAINTAINER](README-MAINTAINER.md) file.

## Install

As a source xPacks, the easiest way to add it to a project is via **xpm**,
but it can also be used as any Git project, for example as a submodule.

### Prerequisites

A recent [xpm](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/),
which is a portable [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) command line application.

For details please follow the instructions in the
[install](https://xpack.github.io/install/) page.

### xpm

Note: the package will be available from npmjs.com at a later date.

For now, it can be installed from GitHub:

```sh
cd my-project
xpm init # Unless a package.json is already present

xpm install github:micro-os-plus/libs-c-xpack
```

When ready, this package will be available as
[`@micro-os-plus/libs-c`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@micro-os-plus/libs-c)
from the `npmjs.com` registry:

```sh
cd my-project
xpm init # Unless a package.json is already present

xpm install @micro-os-plus/libs-c@latest
```

### Git submodule

If, for any reason, **xpm** is not available, the next recommended
solution is to link it as a Git submodule below an `xpacks` folder.

```sh
cd my-project
git init # Unless already a Git project
mkdir -p xpacks

git submodule add https://github.com/micro-os-plus/libs-c-xpack.git \
  xpacks/micro-os-plus-libs-c
```

## Branches

Apart from the unused `master` branch, there are two active branches:

- `xpack`, with the latest stable version (default)
- `xpack-develop`, with the current development version

All development is done in the `xpack-develop` branch, and contributions via
Pull Requests should be directed to this branch.

When new releases are published, the `xpack-develop` branch is merged
into `xpack`.
